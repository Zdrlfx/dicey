# 🎲 Voice-Based Dice Game

This project is a **voice-controlled dice game** where players verbally answer simple math challenges. The server randomly generates a few dice values, and the player says the total sum out loud. The app checks if the spoken answer matches the correct sum and responds accordingly.

It is built with **React** for the frontend and **FastAPI** as the backend API. Voice input is handled via the **Web Speech API** on the frontend. The backend is fully containerized with Docker and includes automated testing and CI via GitHub Actions.

## What the Project Does

- **Dice Generation**: Server randomly generates dice values (e.g., `[2, 5, 1]`)
- **Voice Input**: Frontend captures the user’s spoken total (e.g., “eight”)
- **Validation**: Backend checks if the spoken input equals the sum
-  **Reaction Time**: Records how fast the user responded
- **Result Message**: Responds with a "Correct" or "Wrong" message and the actual total
